########## ENVIRONMENT

#two different paths below allow a splitting of simulation directories and results.
#1) All run dirs are in:
ppn_path="../simulations"
#do you want to delete the simulation directories after each run finished to save space?
delete_ppn_dirs=true #false

#2) location of dirs with results of the calculations (e.g. *.DAT files specified below)
#(Must be accesible by all machines)
path_results="../results"

########## INPUT

#how to provide runlist.txt? specify 0, 1 or 2
inirates=1

#When use inirates=0 range of modified rates has to be specified below.
#Rate ID to start and to stop as given in networksetup.txt.
#There one can find the rate ID in the first column where the REACTION NETWORK
#starts (1 is first ID for first rate in file).
network_start=229
network_stop=230
#factor for rate changes applied when using inirates=0
factor=0.01

# how nice are you? (nice -NVAL)
NVAL=19

########## OUTPUT 

#After a run produced the *.DAT file of the cycle or cycles specified below
#it stops.
#(Because of PPN, maximum cycle can be only be cycle before the T_max cycle)
#Note that in each *.DAT file only 1 cycle is stored.
cycle=(00518) #518)   #for i process example
#cycle=(00125)  #for C13 pocket example
