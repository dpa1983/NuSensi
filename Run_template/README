How to create your own run template: 

Each run executed in the JOBS directory 
starts as a copy of src_template (which is
a ppn run directory).

Instructions:

1. Replace NPDATA in this directory with the one from your installed PPN version.
2. Replace the src_template with your ppn directory.
   The ppn directory is your run dir without any rate modifications.
   a) Compile and run the src_template dir with ININET = 1 in 
      ppn_physics.input. It starts PPN but only creates the networksetup.txt and
      then stops.
   b) Set afterwards ININET = 3 to allow the program to start with the created networksetup.txt.
   c) Add run_sens.sh to your ppn directory.
   Note that the currently available src_template dirs are the C13-pocket example and the 
   i-process example. See the INFO file in each template dir.

You are done!
